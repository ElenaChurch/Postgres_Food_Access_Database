# Postgres_Food_Access_Database
Created a database with information regarding food access and the relation of other factors on food access. We took 3 different data sets regarding food access and cleaned the data using python and pandas. We used SQL to create the framework of the database in Postgres. Then we uploaded our data into the Postgres database using SQLAlchemy.
